This folder contains the tutorial files, they are in .ipynb format which is the way that the common jupyter notebooks are saved. They are numbered in the order that they should be completed in and they should have descriptive titles to help you navigate back to them in future for reference.

## Descritions

01-Coordinates_and_Vectors.ipynb - This notebook will take you through the basics of the cartesian co-ordinates system, and the way we can use vectors to represent positions in space.

02-Python_Structures_and_Iterators.ipynb - This notebook introduces some python structures and iterators. These will allow you to implement vector mathematics in code, and work with time based systems.

03-Velocity_and_Acceleration.ipynb - This notebook will build on the concept of vector position, and introduce vector velocity and Acceleration

04-Differentiation.ipynb - This notebook will take you through mathematical differentiation, and the way that it relates the previously discussed Position, Velocity and Acceleration.

05-Newtonian_Gravity.ipynb - This notebook introduces the Newtonian theory of gravity, using the mathematical framework provided by the previous sections.

06-Vpython_Simulation.ipynb - This notebook introduces VPython, the package which we can use to visualise the orrery we create. As well as bringing together the structures built previously
